#### Discussion Boards

##### Introduction

Please introduce yourself to this class by posting an introduction of yourself. If you feel comfortable, tell us a little about where you are from and any hobbies that you enjoy.

##### Module 1.1 Discussion

**Discussion Question:** Search the Internet for a helpful Java website, excluding W3Schools, and post a link along with a detailed description as to why you found it helpful.

'What', 'How', and 'Why'

- What: What are you writing about? Give the audience a brief overview of the topic by providing them with foundational information (history, background information, etc.).
- How: How is the information relevant? Apply personal knowledge (this can be through research or actual practical knowledge) to build trust with the audience.
- Why: Justify your position and/or course of action. The audience needs proof that the information you are presenting is credible and actionable.


#### Assignments

##### Assignment 1.2: GitHub Repository Setup

For this module’s assignment, we will be creating a GitHub repository using git and the CLI. The repository we create in this assignment will be used throughout the course to host the coding assignments. If you have not already installed Git, please do so before continuing. Go to How to Install Git. Make sure that you include the steps to set the global username and global email address.

**Instructions:**

- Click on each instruction box below to expand the instructions.
- Complete the setup instructions and save the following items into a single Word document:
    - Link to your GitHub repository
    - Screenshot of your GitHub repository
    - Screenshot of your local directory, following the structure format provided in the instructions below.

##### Assignment 1.3

After successful installation and configuration of Java and JavaFX, and your selected IDE (optional), write a program that calculates the energy needed to heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature. Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water in kilograms and the initial and final temperatures of the water.

The formula to use for this program is:

- Q = waterMass ( finalTemperature – initialTemperature ) x 4184
- waterMass is water weight in kilograms
finalTemperature and initialTemperature are temperatures in Celsius
- Q is the result in Joules

*“The joule is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N·m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule.”*
