/* 
(Guess the capitals) Write a program that repeatedly prompts the user to enter a capital for a state. Upon receiving the user input, the program reports whether the answer is correct. Assume that 50 states and their capitals are stored in a two-dimensional array, as shown in Figure 8.10. The program prompts the user to answer all states’ capitals and displays the total correct count. The user’s answer is not case-sensitive.
