Write a program that reads in investment amount, annual interest rate, 
and number of years and displays the future investment value using the following formula:

futureInvestmentValue =investmentAmount×(1 + monthlyIntrestRate)numberOfYears*12

For example, if you enter amount 1000, annual interest rate 3.25%, 
and number of years 1, the future investment value is 1032.98.
