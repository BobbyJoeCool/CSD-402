/*
Suppose you save $100 each month into a savings account with an annual interest rate of 5%.
Therefore, the monthly interest rate is 0.05/12 = 0.00417.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter a month saving amount and displays 
the account value after 6 months.  
(Do not use a loop just yet, as you haven't learned them)
