/* 
Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).

The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equations:
(y1 − y2)x −(x1 − x2)y = (y1 − y2)x1 − (x1 − x2)y1
(y3 − y4)x − (x3 − x4)y = (y3  − y4)x3 − (x3 − x4)y3

This linear equation can be solved using Cramer’s rule
