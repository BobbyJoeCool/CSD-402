/* 
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex and computes the area of the pentagon, as shown in the following figure.

The formula for computing the area of a pentagon is Area=5×s24×tan(π5), where  s is the length of a side. The side can be computed using the formula s=2r sin π5, where  r is the length from the center of a pentagon to a vertex. Round  two digits after the decimal point.
