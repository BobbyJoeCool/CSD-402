/* 
Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and displays three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.4a. Display angles in degrees. (Hint: Generate a random angle α in radians between 0 and 2 π, as shown in Figure 4.4b and the point determined by this angle is (r×cos(α),r×sin(α)).)

(a) A triangle is formed from three random points on the circle. 
(b) A random point on the circle can be generated using a random angle α. 
(c) A pentagon is centered at (0, 0) with one point at the 0 o’clock position.
