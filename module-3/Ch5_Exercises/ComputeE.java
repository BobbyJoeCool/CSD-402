/* 
You can approximate e using the following summation:
e=1+1/1!+1/2!+1/3!+1/4!+…+1/i!
Write a program that displays the e value for i = 1, 2, …, and 20. Format the number to display 16 digits after the decimal point. (Hint: Because i!=i×(i−1)×…×2×1, then
1i!is1i(i−1)!Initialize e and item to be 1, and keep adding a new item to e. The new item is the previous item divided by i, for i >= 2.)
