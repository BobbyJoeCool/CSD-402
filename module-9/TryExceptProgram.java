/*
Write a program that uses an ArrayList filled with a minimum of 10 Strings. Use a ‘for-each’ loop to print the ArrayList collection. Then ask a user which element they would like to see again. Then, attempt to print the element in a try/catch format, which will result in the element being displayed. If the element value received is invalid, display a message that an Exception has been thrown, displaying “Out of Bounds”. In this program, include the use of Autoboxing/Auto-Unboxing, working with a user's String input.
